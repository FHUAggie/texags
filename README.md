# TexAgs.com CFB Recruit Analysis Project

This is an on-going project of a collective of Fightin' Texas Aggie football fans. Aimed at analyzing college football recruit data--both predicting success at the collegiate level and how star-ranking coming from high school is translated by their chosen university into NFL draft picks--this project seeks to cut through the subjective and draw conclusions based on a fair assessment of empirical data.
